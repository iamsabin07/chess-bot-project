# chess-bot-project
This is my first python full project using openCV and pyautoGUI to create a fully automated chess bot.
Created a bot program to play chess against computer in the lichess.org chess website. The program takes the screenshot of the active chess board to prepare the chess pieces before initializing the game. Then the main driver goes through the position of the pieces in the chess board to search for the best move and automatically make the moves. Right now, the program is designed just to play against the computer as the time parameter is not considered.
